      <p>Venus has abundant mineral resources that could be mined for use on Earth or in space . For example, the planet's surface is rich in iron, nickel, and other metals that could be used for construction or manufacturing.
        we'll have you expirment this one of a kind activity with a group of experts in mining and scientists in an ideal place to mine rare earth elements . the duration of the activity would depend on several factors such as the type of metal or mineral being extracted, the location of the mining site, and the technology used for mining

            <p> To travel to Venus, a spaceship would need to have features that can withstand the planet's harsh environment.Including,
                1-Thermal protection *:
                a spaceship would need to have thermal protection that can withstand such high temperatures.
               2- Pressure resistance*: The atmospheric pressure on Venus is about 90 times greater than that on Earth.
               3- Power source*: A spaceship would need to have a reliable power source that can operate in the harsh environment of Venus.
                4-Communication system: A spaceship would need to have a communication system that can transmit data back to Earth from Venus

      <p> We'll start our journey to reach earth's twin planet . 
    It takes about four months to reach our destination , During the journey to venus,
    you'll be able to see many beautifull celestial objects such as stars,planets,and galaxies. However, the view will depend on the time of year and the spacecraft's trajectory.

      <h5>Journey to Danilova and Aglaonice</h5>
      <p>Danilova is an impact crater on Venus, named after the Russian ballet dancer Maria Danilova . It is part of a group of three craters, The crater is located at 26.4°S latitude and 337.2°E longitude in the Lavinia Planitia quadrangle . It has a diameter of approximately 49 km . The crater has a central peak and a bright ejecta blanket, but its floor is flooded by lavas and outflows
        After you view Danilove we'll take you to Aglaonice which is about 360 km away from it , 
        Aglaonice is an impact crater on Venus, located at 26.5 degrees south latitude and 340 degrees east longitude in the Lavinia Planitia quadrangle . It has a diameter of approximately 62.7 km

      <p>Next , we'll visit the highest mountain in venus and climb it !
        With special suits required to protect climbers from the harsh conditions of Venus . Skadi Mons, which is part of the Maxwell Montes massif. It rises 11,520 meters above the average planetary radius . The Maxwell Montes massif is located on Ishtar Terra . The mountain range is about 853 kilometers long by 700 kilometers wide and is notable for being the only significant feature on Venus that is named for a man who's a physicist named James Clerk Maxwell. The highest peak in the range is named for the Norse goddess Skadi, who was associated with mountains, winter and hunting .

      <h5>Explore Idunn Mons </h5>
      <p>Have you ever been close to an active volcano or even seen one ? No? We've got you! 
        Next, with another volcano but this time an active one . There are several volcanoes on Venus, but only a few of them are active. The most recent evidence of volcanic activity on Venus was discovered in 2020 by the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft. The infrared glow recorded by Venus Express for Idunn Mons indicates that this volcano erupted very recently and is still active today.Idunn Mons is a shield volcano on the planet Venus . The volcano rises above the flat highlands of Imdr Regio, an igneous province, to a height of 2.5 km , and is approximately 250 km in diameter. 
        Lava flows originating from the volcano have traveled in all directions, reaching as far as 550 km. We'll stay there for a bit and that will be where we end our trip and head back to earth.
