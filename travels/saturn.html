      <h5>the discribtion of spacecrafte that you need to know</h5>
      <p>1-Propulsion Systems: The spacecraft has powerful engines to travel the long distance to Saturn. These engines use advanced technology to provide enough thrust and conserve fuel for the journey.
        <br>
        2-Navigation and Guidance Systems: Accurate systems help the spacecraft know where it is and how to move in space. This allows it to follow the right path to reach Saturn and make precise maneuvers.
        <br>
        3-Communication Systems: The spacecraft has reliable communication systems to stay in touch with Earth. These systems send and receive messages and data over long distances.
        <br>
        4-Power Generation and Storage: The spacecraft generates and stores its own power for the mission. It uses solar panels or special generators to provide energy for its systems and instruments.
        <br>
        5-Thermal Control Systems: Saturn has extreme temperatures, so the spacecraft has systems to control its temperature. These systems keep the spacecraft and its instruments safe from the intense cold and heat.
        <br>
        6-Scientific Instruments: The spacecraft carries special tools to study Saturn and its moons. These instruments collect data about Saturn's atmosphere, rings, and moons to help scientists learn more.
        <br>
        7-Environmental Protection: The spacecraft is built to protect itself from Saturn's radiation belts. It has shielding and tough materials to keep its sensitive parts safe.</p>
