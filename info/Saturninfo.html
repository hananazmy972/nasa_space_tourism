        <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/SaturnInfo/sizeSat.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p> Saturn is the second-largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of about 116,464 kilometers (72,367 miles) and a volume that could hold more than 760 Earths. It is located at an average distance of about 1.4 billion kilometers (886 million miles) from the Sun.
           <br>The real planet Saturn, we can see it with the naked eye, but we see it as a small point of light that is not bright, and we see it in the sky, but even though it is very far from Earth, about 1,277,400,000 kilometers.

        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/SaturnInfo/struc.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p> 
            Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. At Saturn's center is a dense core of metals like iron and nickel surrounded by rocky material and other compounds solidified by intense pressure and heat. It is enveloped by liquid metallic hydrogen inside a layer of liquid hydrogen -similar to Jupiter's core but considerably smaller.
            <br>It's hard to imagine, but Saturn is the only planet in our solar system with an average density that is less than water. The giant gas planet could float in a bathtub if such a colossal thing existed.

        <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/SaturnInfo/magnetSat.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>Forces deep inside Saturn create a giant magnetic bubble around the planet, called the magnetosphere, which exerts a powerful influence on the space environment near the planet. Saturn's magnetic field is created as material cycles deep within the planet's fluid interior.
            <br>Outside Saturn's magnetosphere,a million-mile-per-hour flow of electrically charged particles (electrons and ions) from the sun, called the solar wind, spreads out through the solar system. When the solar wind encounters Saturn's own magnetic field, the protective bubble of Saturn's magnetosphere forms. Outside the planet's magnetosphere, the sun's magnetic forces dominate, while inside the planet's protective bubble, the magnetic forces of Saturn reign.
            <br>In a similar way, Earth's magnetic field creates a much smaller magnetosphere that protects us from harmful particles emitted by the sun and other space phenomena.

        <h2>Rings</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/SaturnInfo/ringsSat.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>Saturn's ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet, yet the vertical height is typically about 30 feet (10 meters) in the main rings. Named alphabetically in the order they were discovered, the rings are relatively close to each other, with the exception of a gap measuring 2,920 miles (4,700 kilometers) in width called the Cassini Division that separates Rings A and B. The main rings are A, B, and C. Rings D, E, F, and G are fainter and more recently discovered.
           <br> Starting at Saturn and moving outward, there is the D ring, C ring, B ring, Cassini Division, A ring, F ring, G ring, and finally, the E ring. Much farther out, there is the very faint Phoebe ring in the orbit of Saturn's moon Phoebe. The research, published May 12 in the journal Science Advances, pegs the age of Saturn's rings at no more than 400 million years old. 
           <br>That makes the rings much younger than Saturn itself, which is about 4.5 billion years old
            Saturn has the most spectacular ring system, with seven rings and several gaps and divisions between them.</p>

        <h2>Time</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/SaturnInfo/timeSat.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p> 
            Saturn is 746 million miles (1.2 billion km) away from Earth when they are at their closest point to each other.
            At this distance, it would take 622 days, or 1.7 years, to reach Saturn

        <h2>Saturn's Moons</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/SaturnInfo/moonsSat.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p> Saturn has 83 moons. Sixty-three moons are confirmed and named, and another 20 moons are awaiting confirmation of discovery and official naming by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

        <h2>What's On Top?</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/SaturnInfo/surfaceSat.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>As a gas giant, Saturn doesn't have a true surface. 
            The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids deeper down. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Saturn, it wouldnâ€™t be able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet would crush, melt,
            and vaporize any spacecraft trying to fly into the planet.
