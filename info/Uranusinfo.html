        <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/UranusInfo/sizeUran.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p> With a radius of 15,759.2 miles (25,362 kilometers), Uranus is 4 times wider than Earth. If Earth was the size of a nickel, Uranus would be about as big as a softball.
            <br>From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), Uranus is 19.8 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from the Sun to Uranus.

        <h2>Uranus' Moons</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/UranusInfo/moonsUran.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p> Uranus has 27 known moons. While most of the satellites orbiting other planets take their names from Greek or Roman mythology, Uranus' moons are unique in being named for characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.
            <br>All of Uranus' inner moons appear to be roughly half water ice and half rock. The composition of the outer moons remains unknown, but they are likely captured asteroids.

        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/UranusInfo/structUran.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p> 
            Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Neptune). Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials - water, methane, and ammonia - above a small rocky core. Near the core, it heats up to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,982 degrees Celsius).
            Uranus gets its blue-green color from methane gas in the atmosphere. Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and is reflected back out by Uranus' cloud tops. Methane gas absorbs the red portion of the light, resulting in a blue-green color.

        <h2>What's On Top?</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/UranusInfo/surfUran.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>As an ice giant, Uranus doesn't have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling fluids. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Uranus, it wouldnâ€™t be able to fly through its atmosphere unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures would destroy a metal spacecraft.
            Uranus has a thick atmosphere made of methane, hydrogen, and helium.

        <h2>Tour of the Satellites</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/UranusInfo/satUran.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p> 
            In total, Uranus has 27 natural satellites varying in size, composition, and highlights. They are all named after characters from works of either William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope. 
            <br>The five notable ones are Miranda, Titania, Ariel, Oberon and Umbriel, and the others are Stephano, Cupid, Desdemona, Juliet, Mab, Bianca, Belinda, Ophelia, Rosalind, Caliban, Prospero, Puck, Cordelia, Margaret, Portia, Cressida, Perdita, Sycorax, Setebos, Trinculo, Ferdinand and Francisco.
            <br> With the diversity of these satellites, you will always have a new island of exploration awaiting you! Learn about each of these beautiful moon individually as you enjoy your stay- or gaze upon their beauty from our Uranus resorts.

        <h2>Tour of the Rings</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/UranusInfo/ringsUran.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p> 
            Currently, Uranus has 13 known rings. Two are classified as "outer" rings due to their distance from the planet,
             while the others are all known as the inner rings. While the inner rings are all gray, the outermost ring is blue and the other outer rings is red.
             <br> Most people are likely under the impression that there is nothing at all spectacular about Uranus' rings: Why not visit Saturn instead? However, blue rings are extremely rare in the solar system and Uranus' rings not only have this attribute but are also special in that they interlock and weave with certain satellites. 
            The spectacular blue ring of Uranus is believed to be made of minute water ice particles that reflect their astounding blue color.
            <br>Long ago the Moon had active volcanoes, but today they are all dormant and have not erupted for millions of years.

        <h2>Time</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/UranusInfo/timeUran.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>Uranus is 1.7 billion miles (2.7 billion km) from Earth when they are at their closest point to each other. Traveling in a spacecraft moving at 50,000 miles per hour,
             it would take 1,416 days, or 3.88 years, to reach Uranus.</p>

        <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/UranusInfo/magnetUran.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>Uranus has an unusual, irregularly shaped magnetosphere.
         Magnetic fields are typically in alignment with a planet's rotation, but Uranus' magnetic field is tipped over: the magnetic axis is tilted nearly 60 degrees from the planet's axis of rotation, and is also offset from the center of the planet by one-third of the planet's radius.</p>
