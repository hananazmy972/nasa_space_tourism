        <h2>Discribtion</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/mercuryinfo/whatsimporta.jpg" alt="Mercury">
        <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-card" id="mercury">
        <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/mercuryinfo/mercury-l.jpg" alt="Mercury">
        <p>With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.

            From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.</p>

        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/mercuryinfo/908_mercurysliced_1600.jpg" alt="mercury">
        <p>Mercury is the second densest planet, after Earth. It has a large metallic core with a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers), about 85% of the planet's radius. There is evidence that it is partly molten or liquid. Mercury's outer shell, comparable to Earth's outer shell (called the mantle and crust), is only about 400 kilometers (250 miles) thick.</p>

        <h2>What's On Top?</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/mercuryinfo/2138184.jpg" alt="mercury">
        <p>At first glance Mercury looks a lot like Earth's Moon. Its surface is littered with craters that have accumulated and remained unchanged over billions of years, since the planet has no significant geological activity or atmosphere.

            Mercury's surface remains the most mysterious of all the rocky planets, though, as no lander has ever explored it. Some of Mercury's craters have shaded sections that are never exposed to the Sun. Scientists believe that frozen water may exist in these craters.</p>

        <h2>Time</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/mercuryinfo/timeNeptune.jpeg" alt="mercury">
        <p>Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation is not accompanied by sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets. The morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar day (one full day-night cycle) equals 176 Earth days â€“ just over two years on Mercury.

        <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/mercuryinfo/R.jfif" alt="mercury">
        <p>Mercury's magnetic field is offset relative to the planet's equator. Though Mercury's magnetic field at the surface has just 1% the strength of Earth's, it interacts with the magnetic field of the solar wind to sometimes create intense magnetic tornadoes that funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma down to the surface of the planet. When the ions strike the surface, they knock off neutrally charged atoms and send them on a loop high into the sky.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-card" id="venus">
        <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/mercuryinfo/R (1).jfif" alt="mercury">
        <p>Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar wind and striking meteoroids. Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium.</p>

    <h2>Places in Mercury</h2>
    <img src="../images/info/mercuryinfo/R.gif" alt="mercury">
    <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and the smallest one in the solar system. It is a world of extremes, with scorching days and freezing nights, and a surface marked by craters, cliffs, and volcanoes.</p>
