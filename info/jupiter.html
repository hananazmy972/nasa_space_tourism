        <h2>Description</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/jupiterinfo/jupiter.jpg" alt="Moon">
        <p>Jupiter is a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.
             Its atmosphere is characterized by colorful cloud bands and swirling storms.<br>
              The most prominent feature is the Great Red Spot, a gigantic storm system that has been observed for centuries.
               The planet's appearance is dominated by its vibrant bands of clouds, including lighter zones and darker belts.</p>

        <h2>Size and Distance:</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/jupiterinfo/size.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>Jupiter has a diameter of approximately 139,820 kilometers (86,881 miles),
             making it about 11 times larger than Earth. In terms of volume,
              it is so massive that it could hold more than 1,300 Earths within its boundaries.
               As for its distance from the Sun, Jupiter orbits at an average distance of about 778 million kilometers (484 million miles).</p>

        <h2> Moons and Rings</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/jupiterinfo/moons.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>-Moons:Jupiter has an extensive system of moons, with currently known 80 moons. 
            The four largest moons, known as the Galilean moons, are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. 
            These moons are fascinating worlds in their own right, with diverse features such as volcanic activity on Io and a subsurface ocean on Europa.
            <br>-Rings: Jupiter also possesses a faint ring system, although it is not as prominent as Saturn's rings.
             The rings are composed of small particles, 
             likely originating from moons or other sources in the Jovian system.</p>

        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/jupiterinfo/struc.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>Jupiter's internal structure can be divided into several layers.
             At the center, there is believed to be a dense core consisting of rock, metals, and hydrogen compounds.
              Surrounding the core is a layer of metallic hydrogen, where hydrogen is compressed to the point that it behaves like a metal.
               Above this layer is the molecular hydrogen layer, which gradually transitions into the outermost layerâ€”the atmosphere.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="planet-card" id="venus">
        <h2>What's On Top?</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/jupiterinfo/surface.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>Unlike terrestrial planets such as Earth, Jupiter does not have a solid surface.
             It consists of layers of gas that blend into one another as you descend deeper into its atmosphere. Scientists believe that beneath the outer envelope of gas, 
             there may be a dense core made of heavy elements, but its exact nature is still not fully understood.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="planet-card" id="venus">
        <h2>Time</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/jupiterinfo/time.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>Jupiter rotates rapidly, completing a full rotation on its axis in about 9.9 hours. This fast rotation gives Jupiter its distinct oblate shape, causing it to bulge at the equator and flatten at the poles.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="planet-card" id="venus">
        <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/jupiterinfo/mag.jpg" alt="Moon">
        <p>Jupiter possesses a strong magnetic field, which is about 14 times stronger than Earth's magnetic field.
             This magnetic field creates a vast magnetosphere around the planet,
              extending millions of kilometers into space.
               Jupiter's magnetosphere interacts with its moons and captures charged particles, 
               creating intense radiation belts around the planet.</p>
