        <h2>Description</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/marsinfo/mars.jpeg" alt="Mercury">
        <p>Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape. NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.

            Mars was named by the Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood. The Egyptians called it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one."
            
            Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red.</p>

        <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/marsinfo/size.jpeg" alt="Venus">
        <p>With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.

            From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.<br>

        <h2>Activities to do </h2>
        <img src="../images/info/marsinfo/places.jpeg" alt="Venus">
        <p>Mars is a planet of vast contrasts, with huge volcanoes, deep canyons, and craters that may or may not host running water. It will be an amazing location for future tourists to explore, once we put the first Red Planet colonies into motion. Here are some locations that future Martians could visit:
            <br>
            1. *Olympus Mons*: The most extreme volcano in the solar system, located in the Tharsis volcanic region. Its height of 16 miles (25 kilometers) makes it nearly three times the height of Earth's Mount Everest ¹.
            <br>
            2. *Tharsis volcanoes*: Hosts 12 gigantic volcanoes in a zone roughly 2500 miles (4000 km) wide, according to NASA. Like Olympus Mons, these volcanoes tend to be much larger than those on Earth, presumably because Mars has a weaker gravitational pull that allows the volcanoes to grow taller ¹.
            <br>
            3. *Valles Marineris*: The largest canyon in the solar system, roughly 1850 miles (3000 km) long .</p>

        <h2>Moons</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/marsinfo/moon.jpg" alt="Venus">
        <p>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured asteroids. They're potato-shaped because they have too little mass for gravity to make them spherical.

            The moons get their names from the horses that pulled the chariot of the Greek god of war, Ares.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="planet-card" id="venus">
        <h2>Rings</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/marsinfo/rings.jpeg" alt="Venus">
        <p>Mars has no rings. However, in 50 million years when Phobos crashes into Mars or breaks apart, it could create a dusty ring around the Red Planet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="planet-card" id="venus">
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/marsinfo/structurs.jpeg" alt="Venus">
        <p>Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 miles (1,500 to 2,100 kilometers) in radius. It's made of iron, nickel, and sulfur. Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle between 770 and 1,170 miles (1,240 to 1,880 kilometers) thick, and above that, a crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. This crust is between 6 and 30 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) deep.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="planet-card" id="venus">
        <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/marsinfo/mag.jpg" alt="Venus">
        <p>Mars has no global magnetic field today, but areas of the Martian crust in the southern hemisphere are highly magnetized, indicating traces of a magnetic field from 4 billion years ago</p>
    </div>
    <div class="planet-card" id="venus">
        <h2>Time</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/NeptuneInfo/timeNeptune.jpeg" alt="Venus">
        <p>A day on Mars lasts *24.6 hours, which is just a little longer than a day on Earth. A year on Mars is **687 Earth days*, which is almost twice as long as one year on Earth ².</p>
