        <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/NeptuneInfo/sizedistNept.jpeg" alt="Mercury">
        <p>With a radius of 15,299.4 miles (24,622 kilometers), Neptune is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Neptune would be about as big as a baseball.<br><br>
            From an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers), Neptune is 30 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), 
            is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance,
            it takes sunlight 4 hours to travel from the Sun to Neptune.</p>

        <h2>All about Neptune's Moons</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/NeptuneInfo/14moonNept.jpeg" alt="Venus">
        <p>Neptune has 14 known moons. Neptune's largest moon Triton was discovered on October 10, 1846,
             by William Lassell, just 17 days after Johann Gottfried Galle discovered the planet. 
             Since Neptune was named for the Roman god of the sea,
             its moons are named for various lesser sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="planet-card" id="venus">
        <h2>Triton The Moon</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/NeptuneInfo/tritonMoon.jpeg" alt="Venus">
        <p>Triton is the only large moon in the solar system that circles its planet in a direction opposite to the planet's rotation (a retrograde orbit),
             which suggests that it may once have been an independent object that Neptune captured. Triton is extremely cold, with surface temperatures around minus 391 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 235 degrees Celsius).
             And yet, despite this deep freeze at Triton, Voyager 2 discovered geysers spewing icy material upward more than 5 miles (8 kilometers). Triton's thin atmosphere, also discovered by Voyager, has been detected from Earth several times since,
             and is growing warmer, but scientists do not yet know why.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="planet-card" id="venus">
        <h2>Rings</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/NeptuneInfo/RingsNept.jpeg" alt="Venus">
        <p>Neptune has at least five main rings and four prominent ring arcs that we know of so far.
             Starting near the planet and moving outward, the main rings are named Galle, Leverrier, Lassell, Arago, and Adams.
             The rings are thought to be relatively young and short-lived.<br><br> 
             Neptune's ring system also has peculiar clumps of dust called arcs. Four prominent arcs named Liberté (Liberty), Egalité (Equality), Fraternité (Fraternity),
             and Courage are in the outermost ring, Adams. The arcs are strange because the laws of motion would predict that they would spread out evenly rather than stay clumped together. Scientists now think the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring, stabilizes these arcs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="planet-card" id="venus">
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/NeptuneInfo/StructNept.jpeg" alt="Venus">
        <p>Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus). Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials - water, methane, and ammonia – above a small, rocky core. Of the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.<br><br>
            Scientists think there might be an ocean of super hot water under Neptune's cold clouds. It does not boil away because incredibly high pressure keeps it locked inside.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="planet-card" id="venus">
        <h2>What's On Top?</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/NeptuneInfo/surfNept.jpeg" alt="Venus">
        <p>Neptune does not have a solid surface.
            Its atmosphere (made up mostly of hydrogen, helium, and methane) extends to great depths,
            gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a heavier, 
            solid core with about the same mass as Earth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="planet-card" id="venus">
        <h2>Time</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/NeptuneInfo/timeNeptune.jpeg" alt="Venus">
        <p>When Neptune and Earth are at their closest point of agreement,
           the distance between them will be 2.7 billion miles (4.3 billion km), 
           and thus it will take up to 2,250 days or 6.16 years to travel.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="planet-card" id="venus">
        <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/NeptuneInfo/magnetoNept.jpeg" alt="Venus">
        <p>Neptune's magnetosphere is populated with fewer protons and electrons per unit volume than that of any other giant planet.
            Near the magnetic poles, the charged particles in the magnetosphere can travel along.<br><br>
            The main axis of Neptune's magnetic field is tipped over by about 47 degrees compared with the planet's rotation axis.
            Like Uranus, whose magnetic axis is tilted about 60 degrees from the axis of rotation, Neptune's magnetosphere undergoes wild variations during each rotation because of this misalignment. 
            The magnetic field of Neptune is about 27 times more powerful than that of Earth.</p>
