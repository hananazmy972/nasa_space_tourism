        <h2>Spiral galaxies </h2>
        <img src="../images/info/galaxyinfo/image g2.jpg" alt="galaxy">
        <p>Spiral galaxies look like giant pinwheels. The arms of the pinwheel are made up of stars and lots of gas and dust.
            Gas and dust are some of the main ingredients needed to form new stars. Young stars burn much hotter than older stars,
             so spiral galaxies are often some of the brightest in the universe. About 60% of nearby galaxies are spirals. Our home galaxy,
              the Milky Way, is a very good example of one.</p>

    <div class="planet-card" id="galaxy">
        <h2>Elliptical galaxies </h2>
        <img src="../images/info/galaxyinfo/image g3.jpg" alt="galaxy">
        <p>Elliptical galaxies are shaped like stretched-out circles, or ellipses. Some elliptical galaxies are more stretched out than others.
            One might look almost perfectly circular. Another one might look long and flat. Elliptical galaxies contain mostly older stars.
             That means they often aren't as bright as spiral galaxies. They also have very little dust and gas. Elliptical galaxies are the largest
              and most common galaxies observed. They make up about 20% of nearby galaxies.</p>

    <div class="planet-card" id="galaxy">
        <h2>Irregular galaxies</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/galaxyinfo/image g4.jpg" alt="galaxy">
        <p>Irregular galaxies are just that: irregular. They don't have a single common shape. Irregular galaxies are among the smallest galaxies scientists 
            have observed. However, they can also be very bright. Like spiral galaxies, irregular galaxies are often filled with gas, dust,
             and lots of bright young stars. About 20% of nearby galaxies are irregular galaxies.</p>

    <div class="planet-card" id="galaxy">
        <h2>Quasars </h2>
        <img src="../images/info/galaxyinfo/image g5.jpg" alt="galaxy">
        <p>Quasars are compact areas in the center of a galaxy. They give off enormous amounts of energy. Quasars are actually some of
            the brightest objects in the universe. There are no quasars near our Milky Way.</p>
