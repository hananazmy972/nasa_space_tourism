        <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/MoonInfo/sizeMoon.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>With a radius of about 1,080 miles (1,740 kilometers), the Moon is less than a third of the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, the Moon would be about as big as a coffee bean.
            The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away. That means 30 Earth-sized planets could fit in between Earth and the Moon.
            The Moon is slowly moving away from Earth, getting about an inch farther away each year.</p>

        <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/MoonInfo/orbitMoon.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>The Moon is rotating at the same rate that it revolves around Earth (called synchronous rotation), so the same hemisphere faces Earth all the time. Some people call the far side - the hemisphere we never see
            from Earth - the "dark side" but that's misleading.<br> As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts are in sunlight or darkness at different times. The changing illumination is why, from our perspective, the Moon goes through phases. During a "full moon," the hemisphere of the Moon we can see from Earth is fully illuminated by the Sun. And a "new moon" occurs when the far side of the Moon has full sunlight, and the side facing us is having its night.<br>
            The Moon makes a complete orbit around Earth in 27 Earth days and rotates or spins at that same rate, or in that same amount of time. Because Earth is moving as well - rotating on its axis as it orbits the Sun - from our perspective, the Moon appears to orbit us every 29 days.

        <h2>Important Sites</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/MoonInfo/sitesMoon.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>Apollo Landing Sites: The Apollo missions between 1969 and 1972 landed astronauts at various locations on the moon. These include the Apollo 11 landing site at the Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis) and the Apollo 17 landing site at the Taurus-Littrow Valley.
            <br>Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Sites: The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, launched in 2009, has provided detailed images of the moon's surface. It has captured images of the Apollo landing sites as well as other interesting areas.
            <br>South Pole-Aitken Basin: This is a large impact crater located near the moon's south pole. It is one of the largest known impact basins in the solar system and is of great scientific interest.
            <br>Lunar Maria: The lunar maria, meaning "seas" in Latin, are large, dark, basaltic plains on the moon's surface. Some notable maria include the Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis), the Sea of Serenity (Mare Serenitatis), and the Sea of Crises (Mare Crisium).
            <br>Long ago the Moon had active volcanoes, but today they are all dormant and have not erupted for millions of years.
            <br>Tycho Crater: Tycho is a prominent impact crater on the moon, known for its bright rays that extend across the lunar surface. It is easily visible from Earth and is a popular target for observation.

        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/MoonInfo/strucMoon.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>Earth's Moon has a core, mantle, and crust.
            <br>The Moon's core is proportionally smaller than other terrestrial bodies' cores. The solid, iron-rich inner core is 149 miles (240 kilometers) in radius. It is surrounded by a liquid iron shell 56 miles (90 kilometers) thick. A partially molten layer with a thickness of 93 miles (150 kilometers) surrounds the iron core.
            <br>The mantle extends from the top of the partially molten layer to the bottom of the Moon's crust. It is most likely made of minerals like olivine and pyroxene, which are made up of magnesium, iron, silicon, and oxygen atoms.
            <br>The crust has a thickness of about 43 miles (70 kilometers) on the Moon's near-side hemisphere and 93 miles (150 kilometers) on the far-side. It is made of oxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, calcium, and aluminum, with small amounts of titanium, uranium, thorium, potassium, and hydrogen.
            <br>Long ago the Moon had active volcanoes, but today they are all dormant and have not erupted for millions of years.

        <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/MoonInfo/AtmoMoon.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>The Moon has a very thin and weak atmosphere, called an exosphere.
            It does not provide any protection from the Sun's radiation or impacts from meteoroids.</p>

        <h2>What's On Top?</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/MoonInfo/surfMoon.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>Our Moon is like a desert with plains, mountains, and valleys. It also has many craters, holes created when space rocks hit the surface at a high speed. There is no air to breathe on the Moon.
            <br> The Moon travels around the Earth in an oval-shaped orbit

        <h2>Time</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/MoonInfo/timeMoon.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>On average it would take three days, but it depends on how fast you are travelling and the exact route you take.</p>

        <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/MoonInfo/magnetMoon.jpeg" alt="Moon">
        <p>Now, research led by a Brown University geoscientist proposes a new explanation for the Moon's magnetic mystery.
        <br> The study, published in Nature Astronomy, shows that giant rock formations sinking through the Moon's mantle could have produced the kind of interior convection that generates strong magnetic fields.</p>
