              <p>A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying.</p>

        <h2>How Big Are Black Holes?</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/black holeinfo/1.jfif" alt="galaxy">
        <p>Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or “stuff,” in an object.
            Another kind of black hole is called “stellar.” Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of the sun. There may be many, many stellar mass black holes in Earth’s galaxy. Earth’s galaxy is called the Milky Way. Stellar black holes are very cold: they have a temperature of nearly absolute zero – which is zero Kelvin, or −273.15 degrees Celsius.
            The largest black holes are called “supermassive.” These black holes have masses that are more than 1 million suns together. Scientists have found proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center.
            The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is called Sagittarius A. It has a mass equal to about 4 million suns and would fit inside a very large ball that could hold a few million Earths. Supermassive black holes are even colder. But a black hole's event horizon is incredibly hot. The gas being pulled rapidly into a black hole can reach millions of degrees .</p>

        <h2>Could a Black Hole Destroy Earth?</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/black holeinfo/2.jfif" alt="galaxy">
        <p>Even if a black hole the same mass as the sun were to take the place of the sun, Earth still would not fall in. The black hole would have the same gravity as the sun. Earth and the other planets would orbit the black hole as they orbit the sun now. Black holes do not go around in space eating stars, moons and planets. Earth will not fall into a black hole because no black hole is close enough to the solar system for Earth to do that. The sun will never turn into a black hole. The sun is not a big enough star to make a black hole.</p>

        <h2>How Do Black Holes Form?</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/black holeinfo/3.webp" alt="galaxy">
        <p>Most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion. (Smaller stars become dense neutron stars, which are not massive enough to trap light). Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or collapses. When this happens, it causes a supernova. A supernova is an exploding star that blasts part of the star into space.</p>

        <h2>Are black holes actually black?</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/black holeinfo/R (2).jfif" alt="galaxy">
        <p>a black hole is neither black nor invisible as it is an absence of matter, photons or anything you can possibly think of (if it helps think of it as a vacuum within a vacuum) it just looks black to us due to the absence of reflected light as anything black absorbs all light, if a black hole was invisible then light.</p>

        <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/black holeinfo/R.jfif" alt="galaxy">
        <p>a black hole by itself does not have any measurable magnetic field. However, any matter that accretes onto a black hole could be magnetized. In this case, the magnetic field will become stronger as the matter approaches the black hole and is compressed.</p>

        <h2>What is black hole purpose?</h2>
        <img src="../images/info/black holeinfo/OIP.jfif" alt="galaxy">
        <p>Black holes are formed through a clash of Universal energy ripples, or through stellar collapse. Its micro level roles are to: recycle cosmological debris, stabilize the formation of galaxies, define the shape of galaxies, and stratify space around them.</p>
